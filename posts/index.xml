An example system is this:
If you used the last three letters of a website in reverse and add math, every website is easy. For example:
Reddit -&amp;gt; Tid12*12=144
Yahoo -&amp;gt; Ooh12*12=144
This post is a response to the Reddit post. In my view, a password manager offers higher security, convenience, and ease of management.</description></item><item><title>First Post - Why Blog</title><link>https://tsunghanyu.com/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 14:45:00 -0400</pubDate><author><name>Author</name></author><guid>https://tsunghanyu.com/posts/first-post/</guid><description>Why BlogI have wanted to start a blog for more than 2 years, but procrastination and (mild) perfectionism got the best of me.
