I wanted to read [Building a UI Framework](https://software.hixie.ch/ui-frameworks.pdf) by Ian Hickson. However, the PDF file is quite long and I can't read it all at once. To better understand the content, and to be able to jump to specific sections, I wanted to create a table of contents for the PDF file.

I thought about manually creating a table of contents for the PDF file, but it's too tedious. After some research, I found a tool that can generate table of contents for PDF files semi-automatically.
